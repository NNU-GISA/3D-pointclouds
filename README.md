# 3D-pointclouds
My homeworks for the MVA course "Point Clouds and 3D Modeling " (teached by F. Goulette, J-E Deschaud  and T. Boubekeur), using CloudCompare and MeshLab to visualize point clouds, including:
- Basic operations and structures on point clouds (KNN and KDTree, decimation and grid subsampling)
- Iterative Closest Points algorithm for point cloud registration
- Neighborhood descriptors (from covariance matrix) and point classification
- Rendering (Lambert, Blinn-Phong and Cook-Torrance BRDF)
- Surface Reconstruction (Hoppe and EIMLS functions)
- Modelling (RANSAC, Region Growing)
